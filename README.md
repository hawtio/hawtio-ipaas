## Quick Start

**Make sure you have node version >= 6.x.x and Yarn version >= 0.18.1**

Clone/download the repo start editing `app.component.ts` inside [`/src/app/`](/src/app/app.component.ts)

```bash
# clone our repo
git clone https://github.com/redhat-ipaas/ipaas-ui.git

# change directory to iPaaS
cd ipaas-ui

# install the dependencies
yarn

# start the server
yarn start

# or start the server with angular-cli:
ng serve
```

Go to [http://0.0.0.0:4200](http://0.0.0.0:4200) or [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser.

### File Structure

We use the component approach in our starter. This is the new standard for developing Angular apps and a great way to ensure maintainable code by encapsulation of our behavior logic. A component is basically a self contained app, usually in a single file or a folder with each concern as a file: style, template, specs, e2e, and component class.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

What you need to run this app:

* `node` (`brew install node` for OS X users)
* `yarn` (see [https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install))
* `angular-cli` (optional, but useful for development. see [here](https://cli.angular.io/))
* Ensure you're running the latest versions Node `v6.x.x`+ and Yarn

You do *not* need to install Angular CLI globally, but we recommend it if you'd like to use the [convenient commands](https://cli.angular.io/reference.pdf) it provides, or any of the `ng` commands we reference below.

### Installing

* `fork` the ipaas repo
* `clone` your fork
* `yarn` to install all dependencies
* `yarn start` or `ng serve` to start the dev server

### Running

After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. Run `yarn start` or `ng serve` to start a local server which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:4200` (or if you prefer IPv6, then it's `http://[::1]:4200/`).

#### Development

`yarn start`

Or, with angular-cli:

`ng serve`

#### Production
*Requires having `angular-cli` installed globally.*

`ng serve --prod -aot`

For a list of common commands, see [here](/docs/commands.md).

## Testing

### Watch and Run Tests

`ng test` or `yarn test`

### Run Tests without Watch

`ng test --watch=false`

For a list of common commands, see [here](/docs/commands.md).

### Linting

To run the linter: `yarn lint`

## Configuring

Configuration files live in `/config`. Configuration files are currently available for Webpack, Karma, and Protractor.
